# MLEP

Analysis of data from yeast screens, measuring the MLEP score of various protein fragments from the fragment library. MLEP score measures by how many standard deviations away a fragment increases or decreases translation of the protein encoded by the mRNA it is attached to. MLEP data from two different screens (nbc.15 and nbc.18).
